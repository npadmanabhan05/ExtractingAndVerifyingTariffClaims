    ""President Donald Trump’s gambit to make 'America GREAT & RICH Again' with global trade tariffs has gotten off to a spectacularly rocky start as they coincided Friday with a bleak jobs report that showed dismal growth since 'liberation day' in April."",
    ""U.S. stocks fell on the uncertainty of newly unveiled tariffs and a jobs report showing that a mere 73,000 jobs were added in July."",

    ""Still others may concede that Trump’s gamble on the willingness of trading partners to pay more for access to U.S. markets had some merit."",
    ""However limited the real-world impact (and the latest job, stock and inflation numbers aren’t that encouraging), it’s quite clear that Trump’s tariff initiative is unpopular, in part because they fear it will eventually boost prices and in part because people think he’s got the wrong priorities in economic policy."",

    ""Announced 'deals' are nowhere close to being made fully public and are only frameworks with differing interpretations by each side."",
    ""Tariffs are raising the costs of domestic production because half of U.S. imports are inputs into domestic manufacturing."",
    ""Those increased domestic production costs are now being passed on in earnest to consumers."",
    ""The administration is escalating tariffs, with rates ranging from 15% to 50%, and is not actively seeking ways to end the trade war."",

    ""President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs may not be long for this world."",
    ""It’s because for almost a century, Congress has regularly ceded its authority to the president."",
    ""The Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the power to regulate interstate commerce, including the imposition of tariffs."",
    ""It began in 1934, in the middle of the Great Depression, when Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act, which gave the president the authority to unilaterally negotiate trade agreements and make certain changes to domestic tariff rates."",
    ""Over the next few decades, Congress continued to cede more of its authority to the executive branch."",
    ""In 1977, Congress passed the IEEPA, which has never been used by a president to impose tariffs."",
    ""In fact, the IEEPA authorizes the president to impose sanctions when there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat.'"",
    ""There’s a good argument to be made here that when Congress passed the IEEPA, it meant to provide the president with the power to impose sanctions, like asset freezes, to respond to national economic emergencies. This is quite different from the power to restructure domestic economic policy by imposing tariffs."",
    ""It is also rational to conclude that a structural trade imbalance does not qualify, as the Trump administration claims it does, as an 'unusual and extraordinary threat.'"",
    ""The challengers have persuasively argued that a chronic trade deficit is not the same as a national economic emergency."",
    ""At the end of May, the U.S. Court of International Trade held, among other things, that the IEEPA did not 'delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.'"",
    ""This case feels destined for the Supreme Court, where a conservative supermajority that has generally been protective of executive power will decide whether that power includes the ability for any president to set economic and international trade policy without a coequal branch."",
    ""The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to regulate interstate commerce.""

    ""The 2018 changes to the U.S.-South Korea trade agreement amounted to a modest rewrite of a pre-existing agreement, rather than a historic or sweeping change."",

    ""Trump's deal with Vietnam kept a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports while eliminating import taxes on U.S. exports to Vietnam, creating an 'extremely one-sided' arrangement."",
    ""Such one-sided deals are not necessarily good for the U.S., as American companies are the ones who end up paying the tariffs."",
    ""For smaller U.S. businesses that rely on Vietnamese manufacturers, the trade deal locks in higher costs and years of supply chain difficulties."",

    ""Firing Jerome Powell undermines the independence of the central bank, and history is brimming with examples of that invariably turning out badly."",
    ""Central banks that must follow their presidents’ orders tend to floor the accelerator until the engine overheats and the car shuts down. Independent central banks, conversely, speed up and slow down as needed to keep the car running."",
    ""Only replacing Powell wouldn’t be enough to change the course of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy because Powell is just one vote of 12 on the Federal Open Market Committee, and the majority would not vote to suddenly cut rates by the level suggested by Trump."",
    ""If Trump were to fire more FOMC members, such a move would only destabilize the markets further."",

    ""Holding the Fed’s interest rate around 4% makes sense given where the economy is right now."",
    ""There’s a lot of uncertainty about where both inflation and growth are headed, all of which stems not from the Fed but from the Oval Office."",
    ""Trade wars that weaponize sweeping tariffs push inflation up and growth down."",
    ""Trade wars are a challenge for the Fed because they imply contradictory needs: to hit the brake (to offset higher inflation) and the accelerator (to offset slower growth)."",
    ""The best policy for the Fed under these conditions is to stay in wait-and-see mode until there’s a clearer take on where the tariffs land, how much they raise prices, and what effects they have on growth."",
    ""Lowering rates by 3 percentage points in the current conditions would be reckless, foolish and sure to cause an accident."",
    ""A large rate cut would push inflation up, leading investors to demand a higher interest rate (an 'inflation premium'), which is the opposite of what Trump is seeking."",
    ""If there was no trade war, the Fed would have already lowered interest rates."",

When they do, a recent slowdown after nearly a decade of rapid EV sales growth threatens to turn all the way around."",

Ford and Honda have pulled back from plans to release large electric SUVs. Like Tesla, Ford is hoping to push into cheaper (and perhaps smaller) EVs, which is a sensible general strategy, but it will take a while to overcome the loss of government incentives in the U.S."",

    ""EV incentives were always partially about industrial policy in relation to China, and their Biden-era extension carried with it provisions intended to onshore battery production and penalize automakers for relying too much on imported technology."",

In Thailand, BEV prices have reached parity with conventional cars, and in Brazil, the price gap shrank from over 100% in 2023 to 25% in 2024."",
    ""Why abandon such a direct trade-war tool — subsidies that make a major American industry globally competitive?"",
    ""In the near term — and amid a slowdown in American EV sales that predated the Big Beautiful Bill Act — it looks as though the United States will be effectively sitting out the global EV race for a while, or at least coming to grips with drawing up the rear for a few years."",
    ""In the long term, things could get quite a bit weirder. In a world of relatively free trade, the Trump-era EV drawdown could be a chance for American companies to (painfully) reorient their EV businesses around international markets instead of building electric SUVs and performance cars. Or perhaps it will just result in a series of lost years from which the industry never quite recovers."",
    ""That scenario would leave China — MAGA enemy No. 2, apparently, after the Biden administration’s legislative record — to dominate the global automotive industry of the future."",
    ""In a world with more trade restrictions or continued hostility to EVs and EV infrastructure, the rest of the world may simply move on, turning the United States, now the second-biggest car market in the world, into an island of gas.
